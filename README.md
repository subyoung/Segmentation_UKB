<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

This is the segmentation tool for UKB dataset. Cortical segmentation is mainly based on and modified from **[SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg)** repository while method for subcortical segmentation is still under consideration(05/26/2024). SynthSeg the first deep learning tool for segmentation of brain scans of any contrast and resolution and details can found in **[SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg)** repository and their publication below.

<!-- CORTICAL SEGMENTATION -->
# Cortical Segmentation

* For cortical segmentation, the Synthseg tool has been modified to apply on UKB dataset and additional resolution conversion, relabeling and leakage correction method are added. Scripts for both integrated version and separated version are both included in this repository.
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
